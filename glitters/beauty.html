To me, fair friend, you never can be old,<br>
For as you were, when first your eye I ey'd,<br>
Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold<br>
Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,<br>
Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd<br>
In process of the seasons have I seen,<br>
Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn'd,<br>
Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.<br>
Ah! yet doth beauty, like a dial-hand,<br>
Steal from his figure and no pace perceiv'd;<br>
So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,<br>
Hath motion and mine eye may be deceiv'd:<br>
   For fear of which, hear this, thou age unbred;<br>
   Ere you were born, was beauty's summer dead<br>
<b>Happy Birthday To You!</b>
